# Alex Csanyi | Front End Developer

My name is Alex and this is the repository for my portfolio site.
I wanted to create a minimalist, single-page design to showcase my best projects

I'm a Manchester (UK) based front-end developer. I love creating new things with HTML5, CSS3 and Javascript.

Some of my other favourite tools:
Browser Developer Tool, jQuery, GSAP, Sass, Adobe XD, GitHub, Bootstrap, React, Pencil & Paper

In this project beides HTML, CSS and javascript I used the following technologies:

- Ionicons - icon library
- Bootstrap (css only) to create responsive layouts
- GSAP TweenMax - to reveal navigation
- WOW.js (and animate.css) to create scroll reveal animations

I picked Montserrat and Roboto Mono for my fonts - these font types have fast load times and i think go well with each other to give a minimalist, modern feel to the page.
