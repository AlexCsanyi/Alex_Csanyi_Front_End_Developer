          In this post I decided to summarize the concepts and technologies I set out to learn about and try to understand. I had a chat on twitter with a hiring manager recently and he reminded me of a very important point I think we all tend to forget about when searching for jobs. Companies hire you so you can add value to the team and the company.
        </p>
        <p>
          After this I went ahead and looked up all sorts of job listings, looked at technology stacks companies use, looked up articles and watched YouTube videos to try and put a list together that would make me a candidate that could return value in a short time after joining.

        The below list will assume that you understand already that you will have to learn the basics of HTML, CSS and JavaScript (that is the absolute bare minimum) - it serves to help you decide how to further enhance your understanding and to help you focus on concepts that are most likley to give you a chance of successfully passing your first job interview. I did a search on Google / YouTube / Medium / FCC News and after going through nearly a 100 different "junior front end developer" job listings and just over 20 videos and 40 articles there were some topics and concepts that were listed on almost all of them. So let's see what these were.
      </p>
      <div class="tip tip-right">
        <p>
          In my analysis all sources were from 2019
        </p>
      </div>
      <h6>01 - JavaScript</h6>
      <p>
        Here is a list of the concepts in JavaScript I found to be essential to become a Front End Developer, and are listed in almost all of the above mentioned articles, job listings and videos on the topic of "junior front end developer job interviews": 
      </p>
      <div class="tip tip-left">
        <p>I will add links to each of these topics</p>
      </div>
      <ul class="no-decoration-list list-italic">
        <li>ES6 (and later)</li>
        <li>let & const</li>
        <li>Closures</li>
        <li>ES6 classes</li>
        <li>Promises</li>
        <li>Fetch API</li>
        <li>Async Await</li>
        <li>Arrow functions</li>
        <li>ES6 modules (import and export)</li>
        <li>Template literals (Template strings)</li>
        <li>Spread operator</li>
      </ul>
      <h6>02 - Version control: Git and Github</h6>
      <h6>03 - NPM or YARN</h6>
      <ul class="no-decoration-list list-italic">
        <li>Dev Dependencies and Dependencies</li>
        <li>How package.json works</li>
        <li>Semantic versioning</li>
        <li>NPM scripts</li>
      </ul>
      <h6>04 - CLI (Command Line Interface) (and Linux)</h6>
      <h6>05 - Bundlers: Webpack or Parcel</h6>
      <h6>06 - CSS - focusing on the ability to build layouts from scratch</h6>
      <ul class="no-decoration-list list-italic">
        <li>Flex and CSS grid</li>
      </ul>
      <h6>
        07 - One JavaScript framework: React / Angular / Vue / Ember - component based.
      </h6>

      <p>In addition to the above list there were a few other things mentioned in many cases - although not as frequently as the above listed ones. So I would say these are good to have and can be a great plus but maybe not top priority for you to learn to get your first job. These are:</p>

      <ul class="no-decoration-list list-italic">
        <li>Task Runners: Grunt or Gulp</li>
        <li>Service Workers</li>
        <li>Test framework: Mocha, Jasmine, Jest etc...</li>
        <li>
          Mobile development: React Native, Native scripts, Flutter, etc...
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Please remember that the above list is far from a full list of all the different technologies and tools you might find in Front End Developer job listings - but I have a specific type of position in mind and based on my research  these are the tools, topics and skills that are most often listed / required and questions during interviews are related to these often.
