        The All Important First Interview

          A short intro so you know who I am and what inspired this series of posts. My name is Alex and I am a Front End Developer preparing for my first full time position in the industry. I really value the idea to not only focus on developing my own web development skills but also help others improve their craft, because I’ve gained so much from others sharing their skills and knowledge.<br/>This is why I decided to document my journey through a blog and share my experience and build a library of resources I used and use to learn from. 
        </p>
      <p>
          I decided to break down my posts into "Chapters" and document the steps I take during this journey, so you can follow along. In this first chapter I will write about resources and topics I am focusing on and I use to learn from to get my first full time posisitin as a Front End Developer. I hope you will find value in some of my posts and I can encourage you to go out and try and pursue your goals. If you have any questions or would like to get in touch with me - you can! Find me on LinkedIn, Twitter or via email.

            So far I had 2 technical interviews - these both came out of the blue. I haven't applied for any positions at the time and I was only 3 and 6 month (respectively) into my journey to become a self taught developer. I got these interviews because I was active on Github and they found my profile and decided to get in touch with me. The very first position on offer was a javascript developer with React experience. I was super excited and couldn't believe that I got the opportunity only after 3 month - with absolutley no relevant work experience; I never imagined this would happen... and it didn't.   
        </p>
        <div class="tip tip-left">
          <p>
            Don't worry I will go through in different posts what these questions were.
          </p>
        </div>
        <p>
            The first time I had a phone interview with the non-tech founder of the company - this test was passed. In the second stage, I had a phone interview question with one of their most experienced engineers. Test passed. This was somewhat difficult for me. At that stage, I had some experience with javascript and I was working my way through FreeCodeCamp's curriculum but out of the 5 questions that were JS theory questions I couldn't respond to any of them with a clear, concise and straightforward answer. I had some ideas and came up with examples from my experience, but 2 of those questions I couldn't answer at all. <br>
            So you are probably asking the question - who could I have possibly passed then? Well, the answer is: He told me it was refreshing to talk to someone so enthusiastic and he said these concepts can be taught but some of my traits cannot. So he gave me a chance. <br>
            What I think is important to take away from this is that it is not only your technical skills but your personality and your soft skills that matter as well. So I will share with you the strategies I decided to use, to try and "market" these skills. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Where did I fail? He allowed me to go to the next step and that was a take-home coding challenge - (I will share these with you too) - that consisted of 2 algorithm challenges and one question related to objects and arrays (extracting data from nested objects and nested multi-dimensional arrays). <br>
            I had 1 hour to finish these challenges and send back my solutions. I did not manage to finish them on time. I did not have a strategy and I did not allocate my time accurately. I felt like I failed. I sent an email that I did not manage to finish any of the challenges. This is when they told me that it is probably best if I spend more time focusing on building a strong foundation and thanked me for my time. But I did not give up and decided to come up with a solution anyway. I woke up the next morning and managed to solve all 3 questions - sent them my solutions and asked them for their feedback. They were kind enough to send me their solutions and what the optimal answers would have been.  Mine were far from optimal.
        </p>
        <p>
            The next thing I did was to go and start working through the Euler project. I will write a post about these challenges - the thought process behind my solution/solutions. Different ways to solve these and share some of the strategies I set out to use to make sure that next time I will be successful.
