      <section title="The goal of the article">
        <p>
          In this series I set out to summarize some of the most important things I learned about JS, the foundations - if you like. It is now time to talk about what I believe are two very important topics, call stack and memory heap.
        </p>
      </section>

            class="blog-post-img"

            alt="A gear representing JS performance"/>
        </figure>
        <p>
           We need a place to store our data (variables, objets, etc...) and a place to actually run and keep track of what's happening line by line and this is what we use the call stack and the memory heap for. <br>
           Memory heap is where the memory allocation happens and the call stack where the engine keeps track of where the code is during the execution.
        </p>
        <h6 class="main-colour-subtitle">01 - Memory Heap</h6>
        <pre><code class="language-javascript">
            const num = 1;
            const string = 'text';
            const object = {
                firstKey: 'valueOne',
                secondKey: 'valueTwo'
            }
        </code></pre>
        <p>
            The above code simply tells the JS engine to allocate memory for a number and point to the value of 1; allocate memory for a string with the value of 'text' and finally allocate value for an object with key and value pairs. <br>
            The way information is allocated in the heap is unordered; the memory heap is a large space to store data, where our variables point to different storage areas.
        </p>
       <h6 class="main-colour-subtitle">02 - Call Stack</h6>
       <pre><code class="language-javascript">
            function subtractNumber(num) {
                return num - 1
            }
            
            function addNumbers() {
                const sum = 1 + 2;
                return subtractNumber(sum);
            }

            addNumbers()
        </code></pre>
        <p>
            The function in our code will be allocated memory and so every time we call it the engine knows which area of the memory we are pointing to. While we run this function we are using the call stack. The stack works in a FIFO way - First In First Out.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the first step the functions are declared and are allocated a memory; at this point if we were to run our code in for example the Chrome Developer tools and look at our call stack we would see "anonymous" - which is the Global Execution Context. <br>
            In the next step the addNumbers function gets called and is now on top of 'anonymous'. At this point our call stack has 2 lines and we get the sum of 1 and 2, 3. <br>
            After this the stack gets added a 3rd line to the top: subtractNumber, our function where we subtract 1 from the "sum". So now we have 2 as our return value. <br>
            After this the subtractNumber gets pushed off / (removed from) the stack as it is finished and we are now back to calculate; now we have our return value of 2 (3 minus 1); addNumbers gets pushed off the stack and we are back to anonymous and finally anonymous gets pushed off as well and we are done executing our function.
        </p>
        <h6 class="main-colour-subtitle">03 - Stack Overflow</h6>
        <p>
            In this and the next section we are going to look at two ways that can cause our programs to run into issues.
        </p>
        <p>
            Stack Overflow happens when we keep calling a function over and over again. It is very easy to cause it. For example:
        </p>
        <pre><code class="language-javascript">
            function overflow() {
                overflow()
            }
        </code></pre>
        <p>
            In this recursive function we have a function that is simply calling itself. When this is run we get an error 'maximum call stack size exceeded'.
        </p>
        <h6 class="main-colour-subtitle">04 - Garbage Collection and Memory Leak</h6>
        <p>
            JS allocates memory in the Memory Heap but once we are finished and no longer need a variable or an object it gets removed; the memory gets freed up. Only the data that is still useful remains. This is of course to prevent us from running out of memory - a limited resource. <br>
            In JS Garbage Collection is automatic but this does not mean we can ignore memory allocation. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Let's have a look at an example to see how it works.
        </p>
        <pre><code class="language-javascript">
            var person = {
                name: 'Alex',
                age: 30
            }

            person = 'person'
        </code></pre>
        <p>
            In the code above, we have an object called person that has 2 key value pairs and those get allocated in the memory, so person is pointing to these. However in the next line we are assiging just the string 'person' to our person variable and therefore there is no longer a need for the key value pairs to be allocated precious memory; they get 'sweeped away'. <br>
            Another good example scenario would be a variables that is declared inside a function. Once the function has stopped running - so it is no longer in the call stack - the variable doesn't need to have memory allocated to it.
        </p>
        <p>
            How can we run into issues when it comes to memory? Let's see by looking at another example.
        </p>
        <pre><code class="language-javascript">
            let array = [];
            for (let i = 5; i > 1; i++) {
                array.push(i-1)
            }
        </code></pre>
        <p>
            In this example as you can see we created an infinite loop; where "i" is always going to be larger than 1 so it will just keep adding "i-1" to the array over and over again, until the meemory fills up and there is nothing left for us to use.
        </p>
        <p>
            One of the three most common memory leaks that can happen is the global variable. In general we want to avoid adding too many of these, becasue technically each time we declare one we are allocating space for them in the memory heap. So we need to ask ourselves the question each time we declare one, does it have to have global scope?
        </p>
        <p>
            Another frequent memory issue is the event listener. If we add these but never remove them when we don't need them we are causing memory leaks. A good example for this would be a single page app where the user goes back and forth between pages and more and more memory is being allocated to the event listeners in the background, if they are not removed.
        </p>
        <p>
            The third most common way to cause memory leak is by using setInterval. When you are referencing objects, variables inside the setInterval those never get cleared out by the garbage collector. They just keep running and running...
        </p>
