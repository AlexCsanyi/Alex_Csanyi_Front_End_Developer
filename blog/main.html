        <p>Dear Diary,</p>
        <p>
          Grandfather's creaky as his front porch, loads his shotgun beneath the
          awning, spittoon restless for rain, carpenter's chair against the
          whistling air. Rocking, back and forth, rocking snap shot picture -
          worth it, just like the movies

          She said that he loved baseball, and James Earl Jones; said that he's
          got god talking inside of his thoughts while he's rounding those bases
          on his way back home

          In a perfect world we shouldn’t have been allowed to lose sight of
          what it means to love wholly. I’ve got a Polaroid hanging on my wall
          that a friend took of me and my angel. I remember the day like it’s
          something I can touch, but it’s stuck in the square between the
          borders of the film, and I can run my fingers over our faces, but I
          can’t get back to the places we were

          "You’ve got a pain deep in your bones, son. It compels you forward
          like you’re tied to a slave master’s cruel hand, and it's the same
          pain that drives that oppressor’s heart of stone, so you’ve grown to
          love the man. You keep pouring yourself out, again and again, into
          legible lines through a crooked pen." Yeah, it’s painful, but it’s
          familiar – so habit breeds comfort, and I don’t know what I’d do
          without him

          So in the early morning, when you’ve fallen asleep in our home, I
          drift back into the memories that I’ve claimed as my own, and wonder
          if tonight will be a night I’ll hang on my wall like I did before we
          stopped taking photos, out of the habit of being comfortable with not
          trying at all
        </p>

          I work hard, scarred, toil through that soil for the youth I see in my
          friends, but these journals are moments in time, snapshots of our
          lives, and in retrospect, age is an overexposed photo that the
          memories can't mend
